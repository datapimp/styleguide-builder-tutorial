# StyleGuide Builder / Work In Progress

An app that allows you to display examples of common re-usable elements in your application's style.

A Style Guide is a great way to provide a living, visual test of your application's stylesheets, and is a good way of providing front end developers with documentation of the CSS classes and markup conventions available to them.

It helps maintain consistent visual styling and promotes the re-use of existing style rules and conventions, in an aim to keep your front end code base consistent and to prevent the duplication of redundant CSS declarations as your stylesheets grow.
